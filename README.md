# Hyprland-opacity-script

## Required working keybindings for `hyprland.conf`:
```
bind = SHIFT_SUPER, O, exec, /home/evangelist/dev/Hyprland-opacity-script/opacity-control9.sh --increase
bind = SHIFT_SUPER, P, exec, /home/evangelist/dev/Hyprland-opacity-script/opacity-control9.sh --decrease
```

## Note:

This is required: `$ chmod +x opacity-control9.sh`

## Usage:

Key combination to decrease opacity = SHIFT + SUPER + P. To increase = SHIFT + SUPER + O

## For reference:
* The page in the official Hyprland docs relevant to changing opaicty is [Window Rules](https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/Window-Rules/).
* I [reached out for support on the official Hyprland GitHub repo discussion forum](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/discussions/10697#discussion-8436267) where `vaxy` replied twice!
* I also [reached out for support on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/hyprland/comments/1l7tdyf/comment/mysf881/?context=3) where members there were less helpful.
